SIEM Homelab Using Splunk on AWS

I designed and implemented a cloud-based SIEM home lab to gain hands-on experience with real-world SOC monitoring and detection workflows. The lab is deployed on AWS EC2 and integrates multiple log sources into Splunk Enterprise for centralized analysis, visualization, and alerting.
The environment simulates an enterprise setup by ingesting security logs from a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller and application logs from a Linux-based web server. Splunk Universal Forwarder is used to securely forward logs, enabling real-time visibility into authentication events, account activities, and web traffic behavior.
Key focus areas of this project include log onboarding and validation, SPL-based analysis, dashboard creation, and alert configuration for common security use cases such as brute-force login attempts, user and group creation, and audit log clearing events. All alerts were tested and validated to ensure accurate detection and minimal false positives.
This project strengthened my practical understanding of SIEM operations, cloud-based security monitoring, and incident detection workflows aligned with Security Operations Center (SOC) practices.
